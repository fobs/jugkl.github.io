Hallo 

wir freuen uns, unser erstes Event ankúndigen zu können. Am 16. März besuchen uns die beiden [Lombok](http://projectlombok.org/)-Entwickler und berichten über ihre Arbeit:

>If there's too much code, and it don't look good Who you gonna call? Boilerplate busters! In this presentation, the developers of lombok, Reinier Zwitserloot and Roel Spilker, will show the audience several lombok's features. These features take boilerplate busting to the next level, including call-site extension methods, builders, and enhanced value classes for easy creation of immutable types. For those of you that don't know lombok, Roel and Reinier will cover the basics as well: instead of writing out common boilerplate such as getters, setters, toString, equals, and hashCode implementations, you can just use a lombok annotation. Lombok hooks into your compiler and IDE so that their interpretation of your source includes these methods, while you never actually see any of them in your editor. While most IDEs offer a feature to generate the boilerplate, this is little help when reading the resulting code, and such code is much harder to maintain.

* Ort: Fraunhofer IESE, Kaiserslautern
