title: ToTP or Not ToTP, That Is The Question!
author: Roel Spilker/Reinier Zwitserloot
category : talk

<p class="event-abstract">
    Two-factor authentication is more accessible than ever because a smartphone can be found in many a pocket or handbag.
    Time based one-time passwords (TOTP) give your users the ability to log into your web application not just based on
    something they know (their password), but with another factor: Something they have. In the case of TOTP, generally a
    smart phone. Amazon AWS, Google, World of Warcraft, and many others already use this standard to improve authentication security.

    <br>
    It's really easy to add TOTP to your web application, but, like any security measure, it's easy to mess up your implementation.
    We search the web for a few off the shelf libraries, and delve into the various security problems that these libraries exhibit.
    <br>
    Then, when we've listed out all the various security and API concerns, we demo a complete TOTP Web solution in Java,
    ready to be deployed in your Web application.
