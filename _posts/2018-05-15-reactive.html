author: Murat Özkan
category : talk
---
<div class="event-abstract">
    Reactive programming is a relatively new approach on developing non-blocking, asynchronous apps, that are error tolerant
    and resilient under load. We have Project Reactor and a few others, implementing Reactive Streams specification to enable
    asynchronous stream processing in the JVM. In this talk, I introduce the reactive concepts and operations, as well as
    composing these operations into a working Java application.
